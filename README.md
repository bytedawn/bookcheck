Bookcheck is a Python utility that integrates with the VirusTotal API to scan directories of books for potential malware. This tool helps ensure that downloaded books are safe by verifying them against VirusTotalâ€™s database.

## Features

- **VirusTotal Integration**: Automatically scans books using the VirusTotal API.
- **Configurable API Key**: Easily update or store your VirusTotal API key.
- **Directory Management**: Specify the directory to be scanned or store it for future scans.
- **Automated Scanning**: Automatically runs the scanning process after updating configurations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bytedawn/bookcheck
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd bookcheck
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the `bookcheck.py` script:

```bash
python3 bookcheck.py --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --directory /path/to/your/books
```

### Options
